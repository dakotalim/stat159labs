#Lab 8 - Shiny Docs
This lab consists of two files, a data file and an R file.

###Advertising.csv
This is the raw data file, it is read in and has no modifications made to it what so ever.

###app.R
This file runs the code to create a Shiny Doc. Our Shiny Doc allows the user to select the desired regressor from the following:
* TV
* Radio
* Newspaper
Then the plot below shows the OLS regression line plotted over a simple scatterplot.
