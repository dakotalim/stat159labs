#Data
Special thanks to Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani for writting the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning", after which this paper was modeled.
Raw data is available at: `http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv`
This directory contains the raw data (Advertising.csv), the summary statistics of **Tv** and **Sales** produced in eda-script.R (eda-output.txt), and the R-objects from the `lm()` and `summary()` calls in regression-script.R (regression.RData).
